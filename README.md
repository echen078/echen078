ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ellen!

ðŸŽ“Â Second-year at UCLA, majoring in Cognitive Science with a Computing specialization and minoring in Data Science Engineering

ðŸ”­Â Aspiring Human-Centered AI/ML Researcher & UX-Focused Product Builder

Iâ€™m passionate about designing tech thatâ€™s both intelligent and empathetic. I love tackling real-world challengesâ€”from optimizing classroom tools to supporting inclusion initiativesâ€”through a blend of data, design, and engineering. (Ask me about building **smartArrange**, a tool to help teachers group students more effectively, or growing my skills through **Breakthhrough Tech** and **CodePath**!)

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on machine learning, UX research, and using data-driven insights to build more equitable, intuitive systems. Iâ€™m seeking opportunities to contribute to impactful projects and grow alongside experienced mentorsâ€”have something in mind? Letâ€™s connect!

ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: [smartArrange](https://github.com/veryboi/seating/blob/main/README.md)

**What We Did:** Conducted user research with educators, then prototyped and tested a seating chart/grouping tool to reduce classroom disruptions and promote inclusive participation.

**Tools:** Figma, React, JavaScript, Python, Firebase  
**Result:** Enabled teachers to generate optimized seating and group configurations based on student traits and class dynamics.

âœ¨ Fun Fact:

Youâ€™ll usually find me with a matcha latte in hand, coding to Lo-Fi beats, diving into cognitive science research, or chatting about inclusive tech with my Women in Tech community. Iâ€™m also oddly good at guessing the plot twist of a movie before it happens ðŸŽ¬
